# Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). Advent of Code is an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles released in the form of an online Advent calendar.

## Structure

- Within src folder, you'll find individual folders for each day's challenge (e.g., `day-1`, `day-2`, ...).
- Each day's folder contains puzzles folders (e.g., `puzzle-1`, `puzzle-2`, ...).
- Each puzzle's folder contains the input, the solution and unit test for the solution.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions:

1. Navigate to the desired day folder.
2. Open the solution file (e.g., `puzzle-1.ts`) to view the code.
3. Input files, if required, are provided in the same folder.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own interpretations and implementations. Feel free to explore and learn from them, but keep in mind that there are often multiple valid solutions to each puzzle.
